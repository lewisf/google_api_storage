defmodule GoogleApi.Storage.V1.Model.BucketRetentionPolicy do
  @moduledoc """
  The bucket&#39;s retention policy. The retention policy enforces a minimum retention time for all objects contained in the bucket, based on their creation time. Any attempt to overwrite or delete objects younger than the retention period will result in a PERMISSION_DENIED error. An unlocked retention policy can be modified or removed from the bucket via a storage.buckets.update operation. A locked retention policy cannot be removed or shortened in duration for the lifetime of the bucket. Attempting to remove or decrease period of a locked retention policy will result in a PERMISSION_DENIED error.

  ## Attributes

  - effectiveTime (DateTime.t): Server-determined value that indicates the time from which policy was enforced and effective. This value is in RFC 3339 format. Defaults to: `null`.
  - isLocked (boolean()): Once locked, an object retention policy cannot be modified. Defaults to: `null`.
  - retentionPeriod (String.t): The duration in seconds that objects need to be retained. Retention duration must be greater than zero and less than 100 years. Note that enforcement of retention periods less than a day is not guaranteed. Such periods should only be used for testing purposes. Defaults to: `null`.
